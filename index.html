      <h4><P>You’ve chosen a wedding venue, planned your guest list and maybe even your honeymoon. Now it’s<br> time to find perhaps the most important detail: your wedding dress. Shopping for a bridal gown can<br> be overwhelming, but The Wedding Shoppe wants to make it easier for all of our brides! Here are<br> some of our best tips for wedding dress shopping and what to expect during your wedding dress<br> appointment.</P></h4>

         <h4><P>Prior to wedding dress shopping, the bride should know a few key things about her wedding. Details<br> such as your budget, the wedding date, and venue are important to consider while shopping. We also<br> recommend knowing who you want to bring with you, whether that’s friends, family or both. Make a<br> list of all the people who are special to you and be sure to let them know your shopping date ahead of<br> time. However, don’t bring too many as too many opinions can often be overwhelming for the bride-to-be.</P></h4>

<h4><p>Now comes the fun part – when you finally get to shop for a gown! At this point, the bride and stylist<br> will look through the available dresses. They usually start with about five options to get a feel for the<br> brides’ preferences. After that, the stylist will know what direction to go in and pull the appropriate<br> dresses going forward. Don’t be afraid if you have to try on several different ones – sometimes your<br> perfect dress is the last one you find!</p></h4>

<h1>Bring Your Friends</h1>

      <h4><p>Oftentimes when brides arrive at The Wedding Shoppe, they aren’t expecting to find their dress – but<br> they should be! Instead of taking several trips to several different bridal stores in search of the right<br> dress, we’ve found that brides will most likely find their perfect match the first time. When a bride has<br> her “moment” with the lucky dress, it’s very special and should be cherished. We believe it’s just not<br> the same if she’s missing even one of her special people, and that “moment” is hard to re-create.<br> That’s why it’s so important to have everyone with you – family, friends, and anyone else you want to<br> share that moment with!
